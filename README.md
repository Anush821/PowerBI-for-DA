# TeleCom Churn Analysis #

**Overview:** 

we will be working on the telecom churn analysis and here we will be doing a complete EDA process to determine if the customer from that particular telecom industry will leave that telecom service or not meanwhile we will draw some insights from data visualization and analysis so that we could get the factors which will affect the output i.e. churn of the customer.

Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Objectives:** 

Although this project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom firm, the techniques and insights are applicable across various industries. From retail and finance to healthcare and beyond, any business that values customer retention can benefit from churn analysis. We will explore the methods, tools, and best practices for reducing churn and improving customer loyalty, transforming data into actionable insights for sustained success.
